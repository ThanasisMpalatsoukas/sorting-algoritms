# Sorting algorithms

In this repository i will provide you with tools to play with some sorting algorthms like
changing the amount of elements to be sorted and time outs between  each recursion so that you can see
what is happening between each recursion.

Currently there are 3 sorting algorithms available

- Bubble sorts
- Quick sorts
- Selection sorts
